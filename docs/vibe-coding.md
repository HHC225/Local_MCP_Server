# Vibe Coding - Interactive Prompt Refinement Tool# Vibe Coding - Interactive Prompt Refinement Tool# Vibe Coding - Interactive Prompt Refinement Tool



## Overview



The **Vibe Coding** tool is an interactive prompt refinement system that helps transform vague user requests into concrete, actionable specifications through a **two-phase workflow**: LLM analyzes complexity first, then executes structured refinement stages.## Overview## Overview



## Purpose



When users provide vague prompts like "I want to build an API" or "Create a dashboard", AI systems typically make assumptions about the requirements. Vibe Coding prevents this by:The **Vibe Coding** tool is an interactive prompt refinement system that helps transform vague user requests into concrete, actionable specifications. It features **automatic stage planning**, **loop-based execution**, and **seamless feature extension** without session restarts.The **Vibe Coding** tool is an interactive prompt refinement system that helps transform vague user requests into concrete, actionable specifications. Instead of making assumptions about unclear requirements, it engages in a structured dialogue with the user, offering 3 specific alternatives at each decision point.



1. **Analyzing** the prompt complexity to determine total refinement stages needed

2. **Executing** structured refinement through predetermined stages

3. **Offering** 3 specific alternatives at each decision point## Purpose## Purpose

4. **Waiting** for explicit user selection before proceeding

5. **Tracking** progress through all stages until completion

### 🔄 Two-Phase Workflow



#### Phase 1: Analysis (start)1. **Analyzing** prompt complexity and determining total stages needed1. **Analyzing** the vague prompt to identify missing information

```

User Provides Vague Prompt2. **Automatically looping** through planned stages with clarifying questions2. **Generating** 3 specific alternative suggestions or clarifying questions

         ↓

  Tool Creates Session3. **Tracking progress** with stage X/Y and percentage indicators3. **Waiting** for explicit user selection

         ↓

LLM Receives Analysis Instructions4. **Maintaining context** for seamless feature additions4. **Iterating** through refinement stages until the prompt is fully concrete

         ↓

LLM Analyzes Complexity5. **Always suggesting** additional features upon completion

         ↓

LLM Determines Total Stages Needed## How It Works

```

## Key Features

#### Phase 2: Refinement Loop (set_total_stages → respond)

```### Workflow

LLM Sets Total Stages & First Question

         ↓### 🎯 Automatic Stage Planning

   Stage 1/N - Present 3 Options & WAIT

         ↓- AI analyzes prompt complexity upfront```

   User Selects Option

         ↓- Determines optimal number of refinement stagesUser Provides Vague Prompt

   Stage 2/N - Next Question & WAIT

         ↓- Sets clear completion target (e.g., "5 stages needed")         ↓

   [Loop through all N stages]

         ↓   AI Analyzes Prompt

 Completion: Refined Prompt + Feature Suggestions

```### 🔄 Loop-Based Execution         ↓



### 📊 Progress Tracking- Automatically continues through all planned stagesAI Generates 3 Alternatives



- Shows current stage vs total (e.g., "Stage 3/5")- No manual intervention needed for progression         ↓

- Displays percentage progress (e.g., "60%")

- Clear visibility of refinement status- Structured flow from stage 1 → N   Present to User & WAIT

- Auto-completion when all stages are done

         ↓

### 🌟 Feature Extension System

### 📊 Progress Tracking   User Selects Option

- Add features after initial completion

- No session restart required- Shows current stage vs total (e.g., "Stage 3/5")         ↓

- Extends stages dynamically (e.g., 5 → 8 stages)

- Maintains all previous context and decisions- Displays percentage progress (e.g., "60%")      [Loop until refined]



### 💡 Intelligent Design- Clear visibility of refinement progress         ↓



- LLM determines optimal stage count (3-10 stages based on complexity) Return Refined Prompt

- Always provides exactly 3 alternatives per question

- Completed sessions include additional feature suggestions### 🌟 Feature Extension System```

- Session state persists for feature additions

- Add features after initial completion

## How It Works

- No session restart required### Session Management

### Initial Refinement Flow

- Extends stages dynamically (e.g., 5 → 8 stages)

```

User: "I want to build an API"- Maintains all previous context and decisionsEach refinement session maintains:

- "Add authentication"

- "Deploy somewhere"    "status": "awaiting_response",status = await vibe_coding(action="get_status", session_id="...")



✅ Good:    "stage": 3,

- "PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM for complex queries and migrations"

- "JWT authentication with refresh token rotation and Redis for token storage"    "original_prompt": "I want to build an API",# Use previous decisions to inform next questions

### 3. Analyze Complexity Accurately



Determine appropriate stage count:### 5. List All SessionsConfigure Vibe Coding in `configs/vibe.py`:



```python

# Simple request (3 stages)

"Create a contact form"Get overview of all active refinement sessions.```python

→ 3 stages: Framework, Validation, Email service

class VibeConfig:

# Medium complexity (5 stages)

"Build an API"**Example:**    # Enable/disable tool

→ 5 stages: Architecture, Auth, Database, Deployment, Testing

```python    ENABLE_VIBE_CODING = True

# Complex project (7+ stages)

"Build a social network"result = await vibe_coding(    

→ 8 stages: Architecture, Auth, Database, Real-time, 

            File storage, Deployment, Testing, Monitoring    action="list_sessions"    # Maximum refinement stages (prevent infinite loops)

```

)    MAX_REFINEMENT_STAGES = 10

### 4. Always Wait for Input

```    

**CRITICAL**: After presenting suggestions, the tool returns control to the user. The AI must:

- NOT make assumptions    # Number of suggestions to provide (default: 3)

- WAIT for explicit user selection

- ONLY continue after user responds**Response:**    NUM_SUGGESTIONS = 3



### 5. Track Refinement Progress```json    



Use the conversation history to build context:{    # Session timeout in seconds (default: 1 hour)



```python    "success": true,    SESSION_TIMEOUT = 3600

# Each stage builds on previous decisions

Stage 1: User chose REST API    "action": "list_sessions",```

Stage 2: Ask about auth (relevant to REST)

Stage 3: Ask about database (compatible with REST + chosen auth)    "total_sessions": 3,

Stage 4: Ask about deployment (supports chosen stack)

When adding features:            "session_id": "vc_session_1234567890_abc123",Here's a full refinement session from vague to concrete:

- Analyze feature complexity separately

- Determine appropriate additional stages (usually 2-4)            "status": "awaiting_response",

- Maintain context from original refinement

- Build on existing architectural decisions            "stage": 3,```python

## Stage Planning GuidelinesSTEP 1: User provides vague prompt# User selects option 3



| Prompt Complexity | Typical Stages | Example |AI → Analyzes complexity

|-------------------|----------------|---------|

| Simple | 3 stages | "Create a contact form" → Framework, Validation, Email service |AI → Determines total stages needed (e.g., 5)# Stage 3: Continue

| Medium | 5 stages | "Build an API" → Architecture, Auth, Database, Deployment, Testing |

| Complex | 7-8 stages | "Build a social network" → Architecture, Auth, Database, Real-time, Storage, Deployment, Testing, Monitoring |AI → Calls: vibe_coding(action='start', total_stages=5, question=..., suggestions=[...])result = await vibe_coding(

| Very Complex | 9-10 stages | "Build an e-commerce platform" → Full system with multiple subsystems |

AI → Presents: "🎯 We'll refine this in 5 stages. Stage 1/5 (20%):"    action="respond",

## Tips for Success

    session_id=result['session_id'],

1. **Start Simple**: Let the user provide a vague prompt without overthinking

2. **Analyze First**: Always determine total_stages by analyzing complexitySTEP 2-4: Loop through stages    user_response="Option 3 - Project management tool",

3. **Be Specific**: Make each suggestion concrete with technology choices

4. **Show Progress**: Display stage X/Y and percentage to keep users informedUser → Selects option    next_question="What authentication method?",

5. **Build Context**: Each stage should build on previous decisions

6. **Feature Extension**: Use add_feature instead of creating new sessionsAI → Calls: vibe_coding(action='respond', user_response=..., next_question=..., next_suggestions=[...])    next_suggestions=[

7. **Always Suggest**: End completed sessions with feature suggestions to encourage iteration

AI → Presents: "Stage 2/5 (40%): ..." → "Stage 3/5 (60%): ..." → etc.        "Email/password with JWT tokens",

## Troubleshooting

        "OAuth 2.0 with Google/GitHub",

### Session Not Found

```STEP 5: Completion        "Magic link (passwordless) authentication"

Error: "Session not found: vc_session_..."

```User → Final selection    ]

**Solution**: Verify session_id is correct. Use `list_sessions` to see all active sessions.

AI → Session automatically completes)

### Wrong Stage Count

```AI → Presents refined prompt + "🌟 Would you like to add features?"# User selects option 1

All stages complete but still showing awaiting_response

```

**Solution**: Ensure total_stages was set correctly in set_total_stages action.

STEP 6 (Optional): Feature Addition# Stage 4: Finalize

### Missing Suggestions

```User → "Add WebSocket support"result = await vibe_coding(

Error: "Exactly 3 suggestions must be provided"

```AI → Analyzes feature complexity → Needs 3 more stages    action="respond",

**Solution**: Always provide exactly 3 suggestions in an array.

AI → Calls: vibe_coding(action='add_feature', additional_stages=3, ...)    session_id=result['session_id'],

### Auto-Completion Not Working

```AI → Presents: "🌟 Extended to 8 stages. Stage 6/8 (75%):"    user_response="Email/password with JWT",

Reached final stage but session not completing

```    is_final=True

**Solution**: The tool auto-completes when current_stage >= total_stages. Verify stage progression.

}Potential improvements:

```- Persistent session storage

- Branch/backtrack support

## Error Handling- Custom number of suggestions per stage

- Auto-save refined prompts to file

### Common Errors- Integration with conversation memory tool

- Refinement templates for common scenarios

```json
{
    "success": false,
    "action": "start",
    "error": "initial_prompt is required for 'start' action"
}
```

### Error Types

- Missing required parameters
- Invalid session ID
- Wrong number of suggestions (must be exactly 3)
- Invalid action name
- Session state conflicts

## Performance Considerations

- Sessions are stored in memory (in-process storage)
- No persistence across server restarts
- Unlimited number of concurrent sessions
- Minimal memory footprint per session
- Fast lookup and retrieval

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Session persistence to disk/database
- [ ] Session history export (JSON, Markdown)
- [ ] Branching: Explore alternative paths
- [ ] Collaborative refinement (multi-user sessions)
- [ ] Template-based starting points
- [ ] Auto-suggestion based on similar past sessions
- [ ] Integration with project management tools
