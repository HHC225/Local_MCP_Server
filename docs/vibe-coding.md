# Vibe Coding - Interactive Prompt Refinement Tool# Vibe Coding - Interactive Prompt Refinement Tool



## Overview## Overview



The **Vibe Coding** tool is an interactive prompt refinement system that helps transform vague user requests into concrete, actionable specifications. It features **automatic stage planning**, **loop-based execution**, and **seamless feature extension** without session restarts.The **Vibe Coding** tool is an interactive prompt refinement system that helps transform vague user requests into concrete, actionable specifications. Instead of making assumptions about unclear requirements, it engages in a structured dialogue with the user, offering 3 specific alternatives at each decision point.



## Purpose## Purpose



When users provide vague prompts like "I want to build an API" or "Create a dashboard", AI systems typically make assumptions about the requirements. Vibe Coding prevents this by:When users provide vague prompts like "I want to build an API" or "Create a dashboard", AI systems typically make assumptions about the requirements. Vibe Coding prevents this by:



1. **Analyzing** prompt complexity and determining total stages needed1. **Analyzing** the vague prompt to identify missing information

2. **Automatically looping** through planned stages with clarifying questions2. **Generating** 3 specific alternative suggestions or clarifying questions

3. **Tracking progress** with stage X/Y and percentage indicators3. **Waiting** for explicit user selection

4. **Maintaining context** for seamless feature additions4. **Iterating** through refinement stages until the prompt is fully concrete

5. **Always suggesting** additional features upon completion

## How It Works

## Key Features

### Workflow

### üéØ Automatic Stage Planning

- AI analyzes prompt complexity upfront```

- Determines optimal number of refinement stagesUser Provides Vague Prompt

- Sets clear completion target (e.g., "5 stages needed")         ‚Üì

   AI Analyzes Prompt

### üîÑ Loop-Based Execution         ‚Üì

- Automatically continues through all planned stagesAI Generates 3 Alternatives

- No manual intervention needed for progression         ‚Üì

- Structured flow from stage 1 ‚Üí N   Present to User & WAIT

         ‚Üì

### üìä Progress Tracking   User Selects Option

- Shows current stage vs total (e.g., "Stage 3/5")         ‚Üì

- Displays percentage progress (e.g., "60%")      [Loop until refined]

- Clear visibility of refinement progress         ‚Üì

 Return Refined Prompt

### üåü Feature Extension System```

- Add features after initial completion

- No session restart required### Session Management

- Extends stages dynamically (e.g., 5 ‚Üí 8 stages)

- Maintains all previous context and decisionsEach refinement session maintains:

- **Original prompt**: The initial vague request

### üí° Intelligent Suggestions- **Conversation history**: All questions and user responses

- Always provides exactly 3 alternatives per question- **Current stage**: Refinement progress

- Completed sessions include additional feature suggestions- **Status**: `refinement_needed` ‚Üí `awaiting_response` ‚Üí `completed`

- Encourages continuous improvement- **Refined prompt**: Final concrete specification (when complete)



## Workflow## Actions



### Initial Refinement Flow### 1. Start Session



```Initialize a new refinement session with a vague prompt.

User: "I want to build an API"

   - Use case: Business applications, CMS platforms

Retrieve current state of a refinement session.```



**Example:**### 4. Always Wait for Input

```python

result = await vibe_coding(**CRITICAL**: After presenting suggestions, the tool returns control to the user. The AI must:

    action="get_status",- NOT proceed to implementation

    session_id="vc_session_1234567890_abc123"- NOT make assumptions

)- WAIT for explicit user selection

```- ONLY continue after user responds

### Stage Planning Guidelines

```python

| Prompt Complexity | Typical Stages | Example |# Missing required parameter

|------------------|----------------|---------|result = await vibe_coding(action="start")

| Simple Task | 2-3 stages | "Add a button" |# Error: "initial_prompt is required for 'start' action"

| Moderate Feature | 4-6 stages | "Build an API" |

| Complex System | 7-10 stages | "Design microservices architecture" |# Wrong number of suggestions

| Major Project | 10+ stages | "Enterprise application with multiple subsystems" |result = await vibe_coding(

    action="start",

### Feature Addition Guidelines    initial_prompt="...",

    suggestions=["Only one option"]  # Should be 3

- Analyze feature complexity independently)

- Add 1-3 stages for simple features# Error: "Exactly 3 suggestions must be provided"

- Add 3-5 stages for complex features

- Maintain context from original session# Invalid session ID

- Show extended progress (e.g., "Stage 6/8")result = await vibe_coding(

Result: React dashboard with charts, data tables, filters, responsive design    ...

# Get refined prompt from Vibe Coding

```refined = await vibe_coding(action="finalize", ...)

Original: "Design database for e-commerce"

Stages: 7# Generate WBS from refined prompt

Result: PostgreSQL schema with users, products, orders, payments, reviewswbs = await planning(

Feature Add: Multi-currency support (3 more stages)    problem_statement=refined['refined_prompt'],

Final: International e-commerce database    ...

```)

## Session State Diagram

## Troubleshooting

```

[Created] ‚Üí analyzing### Session Lost

    ‚Üì (AI determines total_stages)If session is lost, use `list_sessions` to find active sessions:

[Started] ‚Üí refinement_needed```python

    ‚Üì (AI provides question + suggestions)sessions = await vibe_coding(action="list_sessions")

[In Progress] ‚Üí awaiting_response```

    ‚Üì (User responds)

[Continuing] ‚Üí awaiting_response (stage++)### Refinement Taking Too Long

    ‚Üì (Loop until stage == total_stages)Set `is_final=True` to force completion:

[Completed] ‚Üí completed```python

    ‚Üì (User requests feature)result = await vibe_coding(

[Feature Analysis] ‚Üí analyzing_feature    action="respond",

    ‚Üì (AI determines additional_stages)    session_id="...",

[Extended] ‚Üí refining_feature ‚Üí awaiting_response    user_response="Final selection",

    ‚Üì (Loop through additional stages)    is_final=True

[Final Completion] ‚Üí completed)

## Response Format Reference### Need to Review History

Use `get_status` to see full conversation:

All responses follow this JSON structure:```python

status = await vibe_coding(

```typescript    action="get_status",

{    session_id="..."

    success: boolean;)

    action: "start" | "respond" | "add_feature" | "get_status" | "list_sessions" | "finalize";print(status['summary'])

    session_id: string;```

    status: "analyzing" | "refinement_needed" | "awaiting_response" | "completed" | "analyzing_feature" | "refining_feature";

    stage: number;              // Current stage## Limitations

    total_stages: number;       // Total stages planned

    progress_percentage: number; // (stage / total_stages) * 100- Maximum 10 refinement stages (configurable)

    message: string;            // Human-readable status- Sessions persist only during server runtime (not persisted to disk)

    question?: string;          // Next clarifying question- Exactly 3 suggestions required (not configurable per-call)

    suggestions?: string[];     // 3 alternative options- Single linear conversation path (no branching)

    refined_prompt?: string;    // Final specification (when completed)

    additional_features_suggestions?: string; // Feature prompt (when completed)## Future Enhancements

    summary?: string;           // Formatted conversation history

}Potential improvements:

```- Persistent session storage

- Branch/backtrack support

## Error Handling- Custom number of suggestions per stage

- Auto-save refined prompts to file

### Common Errors- Integration with conversation memory tool

- Refinement templates for common scenarios

```json
{
    "success": false,
    "action": "start",
    "error": "initial_prompt is required for 'start' action"
}
```

### Error Types

- Missing required parameters
- Invalid session ID
- Wrong number of suggestions (must be exactly 3)
- Invalid action name
- Session state conflicts

## Performance Considerations

- Sessions are stored in memory (in-process storage)
- No persistence across server restarts
- Unlimited number of concurrent sessions
- Minimal memory footprint per session
- Fast lookup and retrieval

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Session persistence to disk/database
- [ ] Session history export (JSON, Markdown)
- [ ] Branching: Explore alternative paths
- [ ] Collaborative refinement (multi-user sessions)
- [ ] Template-based starting points
- [ ] Auto-suggestion based on similar past sessions
- [ ] Integration with project management tools
