# WBS Execution Tool Documentation

## Overview

The WBS Execution Tool is a systematic task-by-task execution tool for WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) based project implementation. It follows the Planning Tool and provides structured execution of planned tasks with real-time progress tracking.

## Purpose

This tool bridges the gap between planning and implementation by:
- Parsing WBS markdown files created by the Planning Tool
- Executing tasks in proper dependency order
- Tracking progress in real-time
- Updating WBS file checkboxes after task completion
- Preventing common implementation errors through validation

## Key Features

### 1. **WBS File Parsing**
- Extracts hierarchical task structure from markdown files
- Identifies task dependencies and priorities
- Validates file structure before execution

### 2. **Task Execution Management**
- Executes tasks step-by-step with deep thinking analysis
- Enforces dependency resolution before task execution
- Prevents execution of parent tasks (only leaf tasks executable)
- Auto-completes parent tasks when all children are done

### 3. **Real-time Progress Tracking**
- Updates WBS file checkboxes after each task completion
- Tracks execution history and completion statistics
- Provides progress percentage and task counts

### 4. **Session Management**
- Persistent sessions for resumable execution
- Multiple concurrent sessions supported
- Session summary and status queries

### 5. **Error Prevention**
- Validates task execution prerequisites
- Enforces error handling requirements
- Recommends Sequential Thinking for complex tasks

## Execution Flow

### Standard Workflow

1. **Planning Phase** (using Planning Tool)
   - Create comprehensive WBS markdown file
   - Define tasks, dependencies, priorities

2. **Execution Phase** (using WBS Execution Tool)
   - Start: Load WBS file and create session
   - Continue: Get next executable task
   - Execute: Implement task with thinking analysis
   - Repeat: Continue until all tasks complete

### Task Execution Guidelines

#### ⚠️ Critical Requirements

**ERROR HANDLING:**
- Never proceed if current task has errors
- Validate code compiles and runs correctly
- Test functionality before marking complete
- Fix all errors before proceeding
- Document error resolution steps

**DEEP THINKING:**
- Use Sequential Thinking for complex tasks
- Consider architecture and design patterns
- Plan implementation strategy
- Break down into smaller steps

**VALIDATION:**
- Check all inputs and outputs
- Handle edge cases properly
- Use try-catch blocks
- Test thoroughly before completion

#### 🧠 Complex Task Detection

The tool automatically detects complex tasks that require deeper analysis:

**Indicators:**
- Keywords: architecture, design, system, algorithm, database, api, etc.
- High priority tasks
- Long descriptions (>200 characters)

**Recommended Actions:**
- Use Sequential Thinking tool first
- Break down into implementation steps
- Consider design alternatives
- Plan before implementing

## WBS File Format

The tool expects WBS markdown files in this format:

```markdown
# Project: Example Project

## Problem Statement
Brief description of the problem this project solves.

## Work Breakdown Structure

- [ ] **Phase 1: Setup** (Priority: High)
  - Task ID: 1
  - Description: Project initialization phase
  - Dependencies: None
  
  - [ ] **Setup Project Structure** (Priority: High)
    - Task ID: 1.1
    - Description: Create basic directory structure and configuration files
    - Dependencies: 1
  
  - [ ] **Initialize Git Repository** (Priority: High)
    - Task ID: 1.2
    - Description: Initialize git, create .gitignore, first commit
    - Dependencies: 1.1

- [ ] **Phase 2: Implementation** (Priority: High)
  - Task ID: 2
  - Description: Core feature implementation
  - Dependencies: 1
  
  - [ ] **Implement Core Feature** (Priority: High)
    - Task ID: 2.1
    - Description: Implement main functionality
    - Dependencies: 1.2

## Planning Summary
- **Total Tasks**: 5
- **High Priority**: 5
- **Progress**: 0%
```

### Key Format Requirements

1. **Hierarchical Structure**: Proper indentation (2 spaces per level)
2. **Checkboxes**: `- [ ]` for incomplete, `- [x]` for complete
3. **Task Metadata**:
   - Task ID: Unique identifier (hierarchical numbering)
   - Description: Clear implementation guidance
   - Dependencies: Task IDs this task depends on
   - Priority: High/Medium/Low

## Dependency Management

### Dependency Resolution

The tool enforces strict dependency resolution:

1. **Leaf Tasks Only**: Only tasks without children can be executed
2. **Dependency Check**: All dependencies must be completed first
3. **Parent Auto-completion**: Parents complete when all children complete

### Dependency Formats Supported

- Task IDs: `["1.1", "1.2"]`
- Hierarchical numbers: `["1", "2.1"]`
- Task titles: `["Setup Environment", "Install Dependencies"]`

## Session Management

### Session State

Each session maintains:
- **Tasks Map**: All tasks indexed by ID
- **Execution History**: Record of completed steps
- **Completed Tasks**: List of completed task IDs
- **Current Task**: Currently executing task ID
- **Progress**: Completion statistics

### Session Persistence

- Sessions persist in memory during server runtime
- Sessions can be resumed after interruption
- Multiple sessions can run concurrently
- Session cleanup on server restart

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

1. **File Not Found**: WBS file doesn't exist
2. **Invalid Format**: WBS file doesn't match expected format
3. **Task Not Found**: Task ID doesn't exist
4. **Dependencies Not Met**: Dependencies not completed
5. **Already Completed**: Task already marked complete
6. **Parent Task**: Attempting to execute parent task

### Error Response Format

```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": "Detailed error message explaining what went wrong"
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Planning First
Always use the Planning Tool to create comprehensive WBS before execution.

### 2. Task Granularity
- Keep tasks small and focused
- Each task should be completable in one session
- Include detailed implementation guidance

### 3. Dependency Specification
- Clearly define all dependencies
- Use consistent ID format
- Verify dependency graph before execution

### 4. Thinking Analysis
- Provide detailed thinking for each task
- Document implementation decisions
- Explain error resolution steps

### 5. Progress Tracking
- Check status regularly
- Review execution history
- Monitor completion percentage

## Integration with Other Tools

### Planning Tool Integration

The WBS Execution Tool is designed to work seamlessly with the Planning Tool:

```python
# 1. Create WBS with Planning Tool
planning_result = await planning(
    planning_step="Define project structure...",
    step_number=1,
    total_steps=5,
    next_step_needed=True,
    problem_statement="Build web application",
    project_name="Web App Project"
)

# 2. Execute with WBS Execution Tool
wbs_result = await wbs_execution(
    action="start",
    wbs_file_path="/output/planning/WBS.md"
)
```

### Sequential Thinking Integration

For complex tasks, use Sequential Thinking before execution:

```python
# 1. Analyze complex task with Sequential Thinking
st_result = await st(
    thought="Analyzing database schema design...",
    thought_number=1,
    total_thoughts=5,
    next_thought_needed=True
)

# 2. Execute task with insights from Sequential Thinking
wbs_result = await wbs_execution(
    action="execute_task",
    session_id="wbs_exec_123",
    task_id="2.1",
    thinking="Based on Sequential Thinking analysis: ... [implementation details]"
)
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Enable/disable WBS Execution Tool
ENABLE_WBS_EXECUTION_TOOLS=true

# Planning output directory (shared with Planning Tool)
PLANNING_OUTPUT_DIR=./output/planning
```

### Config.py Settings

```python
class ServerConfig:
    # Feature flag
    ENABLE_WBS_EXECUTION_TOOLS: bool = True
    
    # Output directory (shared with Planning Tool)
    PLANNING_OUTPUT_DIR: Path = OUTPUT_DIR / "planning"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Session not found"
- **Solution**: Use the correct session_id from start action

**Issue**: "Task has uncompleted dependencies"
- **Solution**: Complete dependency tasks first

**Issue**: "Cannot execute parent task"
- **Solution**: Only leaf tasks (no children) can be executed

**Issue**: "File not found"
- **Solution**: Verify WBS file path is correct and file exists

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Parallel Execution**: Execute independent tasks in parallel
2. **Task Rollback**: Undo completed tasks if needed
3. **Checkpoint System**: Save execution state to disk
4. **Execution Metrics**: Track time spent on each task
5. **Task Skipping**: Mark tasks as skipped with reason
6. **Execution Reports**: Generate detailed execution reports
