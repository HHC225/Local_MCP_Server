## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Workflow

The Report Generator uses a **semi-automated process**:

1. **Call `generate_report`**: Provide raw content to analyze
2. **LLM generates JSON**: Following the fixed schema (strategic_summary, key_findings, metadata)
3. **Auto-build HTML**: LLM automatically calls `build_report_from_json` with the generated JSON

```
Raw Content ‚Üí generate_report ‚Üí LLM analyzes ‚Üí JSON Structure ‚Üí build_report_from_json ‚Üí HTML Report
                                    (automatic)
```

### Step 1: Generate Report

Call the `generate_report` tool with your content:

**Input Parameters**:
- `content` (required): The raw text to analyze
- `source_type` (optional): Hint about source ("slack", "jira", "email", "investigation")
- `context` (optional): Additional background information

**Example**:
```json
{
  "input_data": {
    "content": "Database connection pool exhausted at 14:23 UTC. Users experiencing 500 errors. Root cause: connection leak in UserService.java line 234. Fixed by adding proper connection.close() in finally block.",
    "source_type": "slack",
    "context": "Production incident on 2025-10-16"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Provide Structured JSON

After calling `generate_report`, the LLM must respond with a JSON object following this **exact schema**:

```json
{
  "report_title": "Clear, concise title summarizing the event",
  "report_type": "Type of report (e.g., Incident Analysis, Security Alert, System Outage Postmortem)",
  "severity": "low | medium | high | critical",
  "strategic_summary": {
    "overview": "A 2-3 sentence executive summary. What happened and what is the current state?",
    "key_takeaways": [
      "The single most important finding or conclusion.",
      "Another critical piece of information a leader needs to know.",
      "A third key insight, if applicable."
    ],
    "business_implications": "How does this event affect the business? (e.g., potential revenue loss, customer trust, operational delays)",
    "next_steps_summary": "A high-level summary of what will happen next (e.g., 'A full post-mortem is scheduled', 'Security protocols will be reviewed'). Not a task list."
  },
  "key_findings": {
    "root_cause": "The determined root cause or the leading hypothesis, explained in simple terms.",
    "key_events": [
      "A chronological list of the most significant events that occurred."
    ],
    "affected_systems": [
      "List of primary systems, services, or user groups that were impacted."
    ]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "reported_date": "When the event was first reported or detected (ISO 8601 format)",
    "tags": ["relevant", "tags", "for", "categorization"]
  }
}
```

**Note**: The LLM automatically calls `build_report_from_json` after generating this JSON.

### Step 3: HTML Report Auto-Generated

After you provide the structured JSON, the `build_report_from_json` tool is automatically called to generate the HTML report.

**Output**:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "file_path": "/path/to/output/reports/incident_analysis_20251016_143022.html",
  "report_title": "Database Connection Pool Exhaustion",
  "report_type": "Incident Analysis",
  "severity": "high"
}
```

## üìä JSON Schema Reference

4. **Focus on Action**: Provide clear, actionable recommendations

### Writing Guidelines

1. **Strategic Summary**: Make it understandable by non-technical leaders in 30 seconds
2. **Key Takeaways**: Focus on business impact and critical insights (2-3 items max)
3. **Key Events**: Use chronological order with timestamps when available
4. **Root Cause**: Explain in simple terms that non-technical stakeholders can understand

### Common Pitfalls

‚ùå **Don't**:
- Use vague language ("might be", "could be")
- Miss required JSON fields
- Over-inflate or under-assess severity
- Write overly technical summaries for executives
- Include too many key takeaways (keep to 2-3)

‚úÖ **Do**:
- Use concrete, specific language
- Fill all required JSON fields
- Assess severity based on business impact
- Write strategic summaries for C-level understanding
- Focus on business implications and outcomes

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Missing required fields in JSON"

**Cause**: The JSON response is missing one or more required fields.

**Solution**: Ensure your JSON includes all required fields:
- `report_title`, `report_type`, `severity`
- `strategic_summary` (with `overview`, `key_takeaways`, `business_implications`, `next_steps_summary`)
- `key_findings` (with `root_cause`, `key_events`, `affected_systems`)
- `metadata` (with `reported_date`, `tags`)

### Issue: "Content length exceeds maximum"

**Cause**: Input content is too long (default: 50,000 characters).

**Solution**: 
- Summarize the content before submitting
- Increase `REPORT_MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH` in config
- Split into multiple reports

### Issue: "Template file not found"

**Cause**: Template files are missing from `src/tools/report/templates/`.

**Solution**: Verify these files exist:
- `report_template.html`
- `report_styles.css`
- `report_script.js`

### Issue: Invalid JSON format

**Cause**: JSON response has syntax errors or incorrect structure.

**Solution**:
- Validate JSON using a JSON validator
- Check for missing commas, brackets, or quotes
- Ensure all strings are properly escaped
