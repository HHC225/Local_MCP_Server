    """
    Update the latent reasoning state (z) based on question (x), current answer (y), and previous latent (z).
    
    This is Step 1-n of the Recursive Thinking algorithm. The latent state represents the model's internal
    reasoning process. This function should be called n times (default: 4x) to recursively
    improve the latent reasoning before updating the answer.
    
    **VERIFICATION MODE**: When called after verify_final_answer, this performs mandatory
    final verification reasoning using the same 4-step systematic analysis.
    
    Think of this as "thinking deeply" about the problem with systematic analysis:
    
    **Step-by-Step Latent Reasoning Guidelines:**
    
    **Step 1 (Problem Decomposition):**
    - Break down the original question into core components and sub-problems
    - Identify what type of problem this is (mathematical, logical, analytical, creative, etc.)
    - List all given information, constraints, and assumptions explicitly
    - Determine what specific knowledge domains or reasoning patterns are needed
    
    **Step 2 (Current State Analysis):**
    - Thoroughly examine the current answer's logic and reasoning chain
    - Identify specific strengths: what parts are correct and why
    - Pinpoint exact weaknesses: logical gaps, incorrect assumptions, missing steps
    - Check for consistency between different parts of the reasoning
    
    **Step 3 (Alternative Perspectives & Deep Reasoning):**
    - Consider alternative approaches or interpretations of the problem
    - Apply domain-specific reasoning patterns (e.g., proof techniques for math, causal analysis for complex scenarios)
    - Question underlying assumptions and explore edge cases
    - Look for patterns, connections, or insights that weren't initially obvious
    
    **Step 4 (Synthesis & Improvement Strategy):**
    - Synthesize insights from previous steps into a coherent improvement plan
    - Prioritize which aspects of the answer need the most improvement
    - Develop specific strategies for addressing identified weaknesses
    - Prepare concrete recommendations for the next answer iteration
    
    **Cross-cutting Principles for All Steps:**
    - Be extremely specific and concrete in your reasoning
    - Reference specific parts of the question and current answer
    - Use evidence-based reasoning rather than vague intuitions
    - Build incrementally on insights from previous latent updates
    - Each recursive update should add new insights, not repeat previous ones
    
    Args:
        session_id: The reasoning session identifier
        reasoning_insight: Your new reasoning insight following the step-by-step guidelines above.
                          Include specific analysis, concrete observations, and actionable insights.
                          Reference exact parts of the question/answer being analyzed.
                          Each step should build progressively on previous insights.
        step_number: Which latent update step this is (1 to n_latent_updates)
                    Step 1: Problem decomposition and classification
                    Step 2: Current answer analysis (strengths/weaknesses)
                    Step 3: Alternative perspectives and deep domain reasoning  
                    Step 4: Synthesis and concrete improvement strategy
