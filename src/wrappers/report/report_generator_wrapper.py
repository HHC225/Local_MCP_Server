    Generate a comprehensive IT report from any input content.
    
    This tool analyzes the provided content and creates a structured, professional IT report
    in HTML format. The report includes strategic summary, key findings, and metadata.
    
    **CRITICAL: You must ALWAYS return your response in the EXACT JSON format specified below. 
    Do not deviate from this structure. No explanatory text before or after the JSON.**
    
    **REQUIRED JSON SCHEMA:**
    ```json
    {
      "report_title": "Clear, concise title summarizing the event",
      "report_type": "Type of report (e.g., Incident Analysis, Security Alert, System Outage Postmortem)",
      "severity": "Low | Medium | High | Critical",
      "strategic_summary": {
        "overview": "A 2-3 sentence executive summary. What happened and what is the current state?",
        "key_takeaways": [
          "The single most important finding or conclusion.",
          "Another critical piece of information a leader needs to know.",
          "A third key insight, if applicable."
        ],
        "business_implications": "How does this event affect the business? (e.g., potential revenue loss, customer trust, operational delays)",
        "next_steps_summary": "A high-level summary of what will happen next (e.g., 'A full post-mortem is scheduled', 'Security protocols will be reviewed'). Not a task list."
      },
      "key_findings": {
        "root_cause": "The determined root cause or the leading hypothesis, explained in simple terms.",
        "key_events": [
          "A chronological list of the most significant events that occurred."
        ],
        "affected_systems": [
          "List of primary systems, services, or user groups that were impacted."
        ]
      },
      "metadata": {
        "reported_date": "When the event was first reported or detected (ISO 8601 format)",
        "tags": ["relevant", "tags", "for", "categorization"]
      }
    }

    **REPORT GENERATION GUIDELINES:**
    
    1. **Synthesize, Don't Just List**: Your main task is analysis. Transform raw data (logs, messages) 
       into meaningful insights.
    
    2. **Focus on the 'So What?'**: Always answer the implicit question, "Why does this matter to the 
       business and its leaders?". The business_implications field is crucial.
    
    3. **Prioritize Clarity**: Use plain language. The key_takeaways should be understandable by a 
       non-technical CEO in 30 seconds.
    
    4. **Assess Severity Accurately**: Base severity on the actual or potential business impact.
       - **Critical**: Major financial loss, data breach, reputational damage, complete service outage.
       - **High**: Significant user-facing disruption, core business function impaired, risk of escalation.
       - **Medium**: Internal system issues, moderate user inconvenience with workarounds, minor performance degradation.
       - **Low**: Cosmetic issues, isolated problems, no significant business impact.
    
    5. **Maintain Objectivity**: Clearly state facts and separate them from hypotheses or assumptions.
    
    **INPUT CONTENT TYPES YOU MAY RECEIVE:**
    - **Slack Messages**: Team communications about issues or requests
    - **JIRA Tickets**: Bug reports, feature requests, or task descriptions
    - **Investigation Results**: Findings from technical investigations or audits
    - **Email Threads**: Customer complaints or internal discussions
    - **Meeting Notes**: Key decisions or issues from meetings
    - **Log Files**: Error logs or system monitoring data
    - **Support Tickets**: Customer reported issues
    
    **IMPORTANT NOTES:**
    - If information is missing or unclear, make reasonable assumptions and note them in the report
    - Always fill ALL fields in the JSON structure, even if you need to indicate "Not specified" or "Unknown"
    - Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted
    - Use markdown formatting within string values for better readability (e.g., **bold**, bullet points)
    - For timeline, use clear temporal markers if dates are not available
    
    **After you return the JSON, this tool will automatically:**
    1. Validate the JSON structure
    2. Generate a professional HTML report with glassmorphism design
    3. Save it to the output directory
    4. Return the file path
    
    **Remember: Your response must be ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.**

        automatically converted to an HTML report
